# svnwrapper - Highlighting and paging for shell command `svn`

*Author:* Anders Lindgren<br>

The script `bin/svnwrapper.rb` is a wrapper for the command line
tool `svn` that adds highlighting and paging.

What has this got to do with Emacs?  This package use Emacs (in
batch mode) to perform highlighting; with the help of the package
`e2ansi` the result is rendered using ANSI-sequences which the
terminal can display.

This package highlights the output of administrative subcommand like
`svn status` and `svn diff`.  In addition, it highlights source
files viewed using `svn cat`.  It supports all programming languages
Emacs support, either natively or by using third party packages.

## Requirements

This package requires `ruby`, `emacs`, and `svn` to be installed.
In addition, it relies in the Emacs package `e2ansi`.

## Installation

### Configuring `e2ansi`

First, `e2ansi` must be configured.  This is done by setting
environment variables recognized by `less`, typically in a suitable
init file.  For example (using bash syntax):

    export "LESSOPEN=||-/PATH/TO/emacs --batch -Q -l ~/.emacs
                        -l e2ansi-silent -l bin/e2ansi-cat %s"
    export "LESS=-r -j20"

See the documentation of `e2ansi` for more information.

### Configuring `svnwrapper.rb`

Add an alias to be used to run `svnwrapper.rb`.  Of course, you can
pick `svn`.

    alias svn="ruby ~/PATH/TO/e2ansi/bin/svnwrapper.rb -E -X ----"

In the examples, replace "/PATH/TO" with the real paths.

If you have installed this package through the Emacs package
manager, the path would look something like
`~/.emacs.d/elpa/svnwrapper-20180101.100/bin`.

### Installing `svnwrapper.el`

Install the Emacs module `svnwrapper.el` using the Emacs package
system.

### Adapting you Emacs init file to batch mode

If you (like me) have a huge Emacs init file, you might need to
reexamine it, to make sure that it works smoothly in batch mode.

* Make sure you don't refer to functions or variables that aren't
  avaiable in batch mode.  (You can use `fboundp` or `boundp` to
  check if a function or variable is present, respectively.)
* Make sure your init file is quiet.  (The `e2ansi` package
  contains the module `e2ansi-silence.el` that can silence output
  from `message` and `load`.)
* Avoid loading things that take a lot of time, that you don't need
  in batch mode.

You can use the Emacs varibale `noninteractive` to conditinally run
code.  For example:

        (unless noninteractive
          (do-something-that-would-be-pointless-in-batch-mode))

Alternatively, you could have a simpler init file when running
Emacs in batch mode, say `.my-batch-emacs`, and modify the
environment variable `LESSOPEN` accordingly.

## The `svnwrapper.rb` utility

The core of this package is the file `svnwrapper.rb`, written in Ruby.

    svnwrapper [args-to-svnwrapper] [args-to-less ... ----] args-to-svn ...

The following options can be specified:

* `--forward-slashes` Make 'svn status' and 'svn update' output
  forward slashes (useful under Windows).
* `--svn-command CMD` Use CMD when running svn, defaults to "svn".
* `----` is used as a separator between arguments passed to `less`
  and arguments passed to `svn`.

## Limitations

The `e2ansi` package emits highlighted output once it has read the
full input.  For this reason, the output of "svn update" is not
piped through `less`.
